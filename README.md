 As a developer 
 
 I want to create an app that allows user to submit reimbursement forms
 
 so that I can be reimbursed for expendetures for company funtions
 
 Given that sometimes I must spend personal money while directly contributing to company profit
 
 I should not have to come out of pocket while providing such work for my company
 
 I should be refunded all money I spend from personal accounts directly related to company work
